===========================================================
 1   I N T R O D U C T I O N
===========================================================
 1.1   Introduction
===================
"Wars of Napoleon Strategy Game" is a 1 or 2-player VGA graphic
strategic level wargame of the Napoleonic era. The registered
version of the game includes a tactical level module which
permits individual battles to be fought. The game requires VGA.
It is provided "as is" without any warranty of any kind. It has
been tested on several types of IBM compatibles (from 386 to
Pentium) but it is impossible to try all the combinations of
equipment that exist.

The object of the game is to accumulate as many victory
points as possible. The game is played in turns of 2 months
during which both sides perform their actions. Decisions are
made using menus which are described below.

 1.2   Requirements
===================
The program requires the following files:
WON.EXE         - the main stregic level game program
NAPOLEON.EXE    - tactical level game module
NWS.CFG         - your customizable configuration file
NWSxxxx.INI     - initialization data file for year xxxx
LEADxxxx.DAT    - army leader data file for year xxxx
EUROxxxx.MAP    - city data file for year xxxx
WON.DOC         - this documentation file
HISCORE.NWS     - high score file
GAMESATA.INI    - initialization data file

In addition, the program requires several *.VGA and *.EGA
files for graphical effects.

There are other optional files that may be produced as you
customize and play the game.

 1.3   Running the Game
=======================
Type 'NWS' at the command line prompt. The title screen
display will appear while the game initializes.

The option to load a game or begin a new game is given at
the beginning of the game, in addition to being available

				- 2  -
 
during the game.

 1.4  Tactical Level Game
=========================
In addition to the main strategy level game of NWS.EXE,
there is a tactical level game, NAPOLEON.EXE, which in the
registered version may be linked to the strategic game
by setting the TACTICAL option in the Utility Menu of NWS.

In the shareware version, you may still play the battle of
Waterloo by typing 'NAPOLEON' at the command line prompt.

 1.5   Running from Windows
===========================
This is a DOS-based game, but it can be run under Windows* or
Windows 95 using the RUN command (using the Start with
Windows 95 or the File Manager in Windows). You will need to
type both the path and file name to run the program.
Typically this will be:

C:\NWS\NWS.EXE

Both Windows and Windows 95 carry overhead that may slow the
game. If this is a problem, you should exit Windows or
Windows 95, then change to the NWS directory and run the
program under DOS.

(*Windows and Windows 95 are trademarks of Microsoft).

 1.6   How to Win
=================
You are awarded victory points for (1) capturing cities, (2)
capturing armies, (3) winning battles, and (4) special
events. Each city you control gives you a certain number of
victory points (and a like amount of income). This varies
depending on the city. For instance, a large city such as
Paris is worth more than a smaller city such as Metz. To see
the number of victory points each city is worth, use the
"Inform" option to access the "Cities" report.

Objective cities are worth an additional bonus of 100 victory
points in addition to the normal victory points. If you lose
your objective, you permanently lose the bonus income.
Additionally, the game will end unless the "Objective" end game
condition is de-selected.


				- 3  -
 
If your army defeats an enemy that has no route for retreat
or causes enough casualties to crush the enemy, you capture
the army and receive a bonus of 25 victory points.
Eliminating the enemy fleet also results in bonus victory
points.

For each battle you win, you receive 1 victory point.
Certain special events result in extra victory points for
one side or the other.

The game continues until one side achieves an end game
condition. (See End Game Conditions under the "Utility"
submenu). The side that triggers the end of the game
receives an additional bonus of 100 victory points.

If your score is one of the top 5 scores for the side
played, your name and score are entered into the high score
file.

When the game is over, you are returned to the opening
screen, with the option to quit, load a game or begin a new
game.

 1.7   Map Display
==================
The title screen will clear and a map of western Europe
will appear along with a menu entitled 'Main'. This is the
Main Menu from which you choose most of your options. Above
the menu is a box showing which side is currently selected,
French or Allies and the number of victory points for that
side.

The small colored circles on the map display are cities or
other key locations. There are a total of 67 such locations.
Blue circles are French controlled; red ones are Allied
controlled. Gray circles are true neutral cities (e.g. Bern,
Switzerland). Green circles are Allied cities at peace: they
belong to a potentially Allied country, but the country has
not yet gone to war. Two of the cities are OBJECTIVE cities,
and their circle is marked with a small yellow cross.
Connections between the cities will be shown by dashed
lines.

If the circle representing the city is surrounded by a
HOLLOW BLACK box, it is a FORTIFIED (FORT+)location; if
surrounded by a SOLID BLACK box, the location is HEAVILY

				- 4  -
 
FORTIFIED (FORT++). Any level of fortification tends to
improve resistance to enemy attacks.

Small flag icons appear next to some cities. Each flag
represents an army

 1.8   Nationality
==================
Each city on the display is related to a country. Each army
raised has the nationality of the country associated with
the city where it was first formed. Each commander also has
a nationality. If the commander happens to lead an army of
different nationality from his own, the entire unit will
suffer a cohesion penalty in combat.

The following countries are potentially ALLIED countries:
        Austria
        England
        Russia
        Prussia
        Spain

The remaining countries (e.g., Switzerland) are truly
neutral, and though they may be drawn into the conflict,
they will not join the alliance.

At the beginning of the game, many of the Allied countries
may be at peace. While an Allied country is not at war, it
does not contribute to Allied income, nor can armies be
recruited in the cities of that country by the Allies. Such
cities are represented by green circles.

If a nonaligned Allied country is invaded by France it
automatically enters the war. (Allied armies can pass or
retreat through nonaligned Allied cities with no effect).

Any city currently possessed will contribute to income.
However, recruiting can only be done in certain cities:

                                    RECRUITING
                    +--------------------------------------+

 1.9   Hot Keys
===============
There are several game command short cut or hot keys that
are useful:

F1 - shows a list of the hot keys
F3 - redraw the screen
F4 - show a summary of unit strengths in each occupied city
F7 - speed "End Turn" key: avoids the "are you sure" prompt

 1.10  Using the Menus
======================
You may move the highlighted menu option by pressing the
"up" and "down" arrow keys. Pressing 'Enter' will select the
currently highlighted option. In most cases, you may exit
from a menu without selecting any option by pressing the
"esc" key.

Hot keys" are provided to speed menu access. The first
letter of each command will immediately select the item
without having to move the menu bar. WARNING: In responding
to city locations, watch out for cities that have the same
first letter. Using the hot key will select the FIRST city
on the menu that begins with the letter you press. If you
wanted to select another, you must use the up/down arrow
keys. Example: You have the option to recruit at Sardinia or
Sicily, both of which begin with "S". If you press "S",
Sardinia will be selected because it comes first
alphabetically in the menu list. If you want to select
Sicily instead, you must use the arrow keys. (If there had
been no other cities beginning with "S" except for Sicily
the hot key would have worked fine).

For the Option and Utility menus, the cursor stays on the
submenu if there are more choices available for the item
currently being selected (e.g., more troops to be drilled).

				- 6  -
 
Otherwise it returns to the main menu and stays on the
Option or Utility item.

PLEASE NOTE: TO RETURN TO THE MAIN MENU FROM EITHER THE
COMMANDS OR UTILITY MENU, PRESS THE "ESCAPE" KEY ("Esc").

 1.11  Game Setup
=================
There are several setup options available which can be
accessed from the "UTILITY" option of the Main Menu. You can
swap sides, select 1- or 2-player options, control sound and
graphic options, and adjust difficulty. When you save a
game, the configuration file is automatically updated to the
current set of options you have chosen.

 1.12  Sequence of Play
=======================
Play proceeds in the following sequence for each game turn
(representing 2 months):

  A. Decision Phase
      Side 1 Decisions
             (French if 2 players ; Human if 1 player)

===========================================================
 2   D E C I S I O N    P H A S E
===========================================================
 2.1   Land Movement

				- 7  -
 
====================
Movement is from city to city (point-to-point movement) by
armies. Any number of friendly armies may stack in a city. A
small number appears on the unit icon to show how many units
are in the stack. Armies that move to a city occupied by an
enemy army must fight the enemy, and either drive off the
enemy (to capture the city) or be forced back themselves.

The move-to-menu for army shows the name of the occupying
army if the target city is occupied.

NOTE: If there is more than one army in an occupied city
that another army is viewing to move to, the name and
strength of only one army is shown. You will need to consult
the INFORM option to determine all the armies in that
particular city.

Moving into an enemy city that is not occupied by an army
results in automatic capture of the city. Movement into a
"true" neutral city automatically captures the neutral city.
The city will change colors to indicate change in control.

Fighting to capture an occupied fortified city reduces the
fortification by one level. (Thus, a FORTIFIED+ city would
be reduced to an unfortified city.) When an army captures an
unoccupied fortified city, the fort is not necessarily
reduced. The victorious army is given the option to raze the
fortifications. Note that razing TOTALLY destroys the forts,
even if they were double fortified.

 2.2   Army Attributes
======================
Armies have several attributes of importance. These will
change as the game progresses, and it is important for you
to understand how they influence the outcomes.

STRENGTH   - the number of men in the unit; the prime
             attribute in combat

LEADER     - ability score of the unit leader, from 1 to 10.
             Greatly affects the unit's effectiveness in
             battle and movement.

EXPERIENCE - the number of battles the unit has won (0-10).
             More experienced units are more effective in
             combat. Each battle won increases the

				- 8  -
 
             experience level by 1.

SUPPLY     - the current state of food and equipment (0-10).
             Units use 1 unit of supply each turn, except in
             summer and autumn harvest months. Capturing
             cities and capturing enemy armies increases
             supply. Moving and fighting accelerate use of
             supplies. Units that are surrounded in enemy
             countries use supplies at an accelerated rate.
             Units that are 'out of supply'(supply level=0) fight
             at 50% effectiveness, and move more slowly. In
             winter months out of supply units cannot move at
             all. Units that are out of supply are marked with an
             "S" to make them easier to locate. Armies in port
             cities are always in supply if the city is not
             blockaded.

 2.3   Napoleon
===============
The stack commanded by Napoleon has some special abilities.
His leadership bonus is very large. Unlike all other
commanders,if he is defeated he is not necessarily eliminated
from the game. He may be banished to Corsica with his unit size
reduced to 1,000 soldiers. The French score will be reduced by
half and the strength of all French units will be reduced by
half. However, with fleet support, Napoleon can escape from
Corsica back to the continent and the war may continue.

 3.2   Recruit
==============
Allows you to recruit new armies or build up existing
armies. Each recruitment requires 100 money units. If you do
not have enough money, you cannot recruit.

You will be given several randomly selected cities where you
may recruit. These will either be cities you originally
owned or neutral cities you have captured. If the city is
vacant, a NEW army is placed there, along with a commander
and his corresponding abilities. ADDing recruits to an
existing army increases its strength, but does not change
the commander.

Newly created armies MAY NOT move the turn they are created,
while they train and organize. Existing armies that are
increased in strength CAN MOVE in the current turn.

The size of newly created armies depends on where they are
recruited. The larger the city and higher the income it
produces, the larger the number of recruits. For instance,
if you are playing the French, you will build bigger armies
faster by recruiting in Paris versus other cities.
Experience level of recruits will be low (varies slightly,
with slightly better levels for French armies).

NOTE: Once you have begin to recruit, you should NOT change
      sides or number of players, since the cities to
      recruit in are already selected for that part of the
      turn.

 3.3   Commanders
=================
Each side has 25 commanders available to lead separate
armies. As the game progresses, the number of available
commanders will be reduced as commanders are captured or are
used to lead other units. (When units are captured, the
commanders are removed from play. An exception is Napoleon,
who will continue in play if possible).

If the list of 25 preset commanders is exhausted, there is
list of "generic" commanders provided so you can still
continue the game. Generic units are given Roman numeral
identifiers. For instance, French army 12 is designated
French XII. Allies army number 27 (being the second Allied

				- 10  -
 
army) is designated Allies II, and so forth.

 3.4   Ships
============
Allows you to build and move fleets and bombard enemy
cities. Each side has one fleet, consisting of 0-10 ships.
Ships can be added to the fleet only in port cities
controlled by that side.

Ships cost 100 money units. In each turn, they can be moved
to any other port city. This means ships may move much more
rapidly than armies, but their effect is different.

If the two fleets meet in a port, they will engage in
combat. During each round of combat, the attacker has the
option to press the attack or retire. Each ship can take 10
hits before it sinks. The current number of hits remaining
is shown below the ship icon. Combat continues until one
fleet either retreats or is eliminated. At the end of the
turn, there can be only one fleet in a given port.

English ships have a 10% combat advantage.

Ships can bombard enemy cities to damage defending armies or
fortifications, or to drive the city to neutrality. If the
city has an enemy army, the bombardment will damage the
enemy. The fleet will also blockade the enemy army in the
port, reducing his supplies. Fortified cities may have the
forts damaged or reduced. However, forts may sink attacking
ships.

Unfortified cities not occupied by a defending army may
become neutral as a result of the bombardment.

 3.5   Fast Naval Combat
========================
The normal naval combat speed will be accelerated if you
press any key after combat has begun.
 
 3.6   Invasions - Marines
==========================
Small scale invasions by marine units from the fleet may be
conducted only when the port city to be invaded is not
hostile (either originally neutral or after being bombarded
into neutrality) at neutral cities if there is more than one
ship in the invading fleet. The fleet size will be reduced

				- 11  -
 
by 1 and the new army will seize the neutral city, under the
leadership of the next available commander. The invading
army is small and vulnerable to counterattack

 3.7   Raid Commerce
====================
Ships from both sides have the option to raid enemy commerce
on the high seas. This is shown as the "Raid" option on the
Ships menu. Selecting this option will cause a red box to
appear, with the word "Commerce" in it, along with the ship
icon. Each turn that the fleet stays in this box, there is a
probability of doing damage to the enemy by destroying
commerce and thereby reducing his income. There is also a
chance that one or more of the raiding ships will be sunk.
If both fleets enter the commerce raiding zone, combat will
occur and one fleet will either be destroyed or have to
retreat. Only one fleet can remain in this zone at the end
of the turn; that fleet will then attempt to raid enemy
commerce.

 3.8   Move Orders
==================
Allows you to select an army to move and where to move it. A
menu will cycle through all your armies that are able to
move this turn. Armies that already have move orders, or
that have been combined this turn, or that have built
fortifications this turn, or newly created armies are not
eligible to move in the current turn.

Once you select the army to move, the choice of all possible
connecting destinations for that army are shown. Selecting a
destination will result in a white dotted line from the
selected unit to the destination. Note that the army does
not move immediately. Rather, it will make its move during
the move and update phase.

If an army with move orders is attacked during the move and
update phase, there is a chance that it will not be able to
carry out those orders. If it is defeated, it must retreat,
but even if it wins it may have its movement orders
cancelled.

 3.9   Movement Across the Sea
==============================
Movement between England and the continent (e.g. London to
Amsterdam) or between Sicily (or Sardinia) and the continent

				- 12  -
 
is considered movement across the sea and requires that
special conditions be met: a) Your friendly fleet must be in the
port city where the army is moving FROM

b) The port city where the army is moving TO must NOT be
   occupied by the opposing fleet

 3.10  Next Turn
================
When you have completed your decisions for the current turn,
select this option to continue with the game sequence. Note
that once the game sequence progresses, you cannot back up.
Thus, when you select this option, you will be asked to
confirm before the turn actually progresses.

 3.11  Inform (Reports)
=======================
Seven different reports are potentially available; there is
no cost for any of the reports.

  1) Friendly Army report
       Shows the status of all your armies, and other useful
       statistics on the progress of the game. After the
       first turn, it will also show the total strength of
       the enemy forces.

  2) Enemy Army report
       Shows information similar to Friendly army report,
       except that it shows less complete information on the
       enemy forces. It includes the composition of the
       enemy navy.

  3) City report
       Provides information on the cities, their worth,
       status, and so on.

  4) Force summary
       Shows on the map the strength of all armies (in 100's
       of men). Because of the importance of knowing the
       force strengths, there is a hot key (F4) to access this
       information directly without having to go through the
       menu.

  5) Intelligence report
       Provides an on-map summary of attributes of all
       FRIENDLY armies (strength, leadership, experience,

				- 13  -
 
       and supply).

  6) Battle Summary report
       Shows number of battles won and casualties incurred
       for each side.

  7) Recap report (available only if HISTORY option is ON in
     the Utility menu). Scrolls through a chronicle of the
     history of the game thus far (battle outcomes and
     losses)

     Typical chronicle entries might look like this:

  Metz *Napoleon (3200/29600) defeats Alvintzi (5400/30200)
  Berlin BlÅcher (1200/59900) defeats *Grouchy (3900/22400)

     The asterisk indicates the attacker. Casualties and
     total troop strength are indicated in the parentheses.

 3.12  Commands
===============
See Commands Submenu for a description of the choices. These
generally relate to special commands available for
individual armies.

 3.13  Utility
==============
See Utility Submenu. These provide game options that allow
various features of overall game play to be modified.

 3.14  Files
============
Allows you to load or save games and to quit the program.
There can be up to 8 user-saved games,"NWSx.SAV", where "x"
is a number from 1 to 8. Those file names for which a saved
game exists are marked with a "˚" as a reminder. When the
game is started, the base game is automatically initialized,
configured according to the current NWS.CFG settings.

 3.15  Autosave
===============
There is one additional saved game file NWS9.SAV, the
autosave file, that is automatically updated at the end of
each decision phase. This provides a backup in case the game
is interrupted for any reason. The game can be resumed by
loading the NWS9.SAV file.

 4.2   Cancel
=============
Allows the move orders for unit selected (menu with eligible
units will be displayed) to be cancelled - in case you
change your mind before you go to the next turn.

 4.3   Fortify
==============
If ALL the following conditions are met, you may fortify a
city:
1. City is occupied by a friendly army
2. City is not already at DOUBLE FORTIFIED ++ level
3. You have at least 200 money units

All cities meeting these conditions, will appear in a menu
of candidates. Selecting a city to fortify will cause the
city icon to be updated on the game display. The army
occupying a city that is fortified loses its turn (it is
presumably busy building fortifications) and will be shown
as 'Resting' in the Army report.

An army may increase a given city's fortifications by 1
level per turn. If there are 2 units in a city, each army
may add 1 level of fortification in a turn, thereby double
fortifying the city.


				- 15  -
 
 4.4   Join (Combine)
=====================
Up to a certain level, friendly armies may be combined to
create larger and more powerful forces. In order to combine,
armies must start the turn stacked in the same city. Stacked
armies are indicated by a small gold circle on the flag
icon. Selecting 'Combine' will result in a menu of candidate
cities in which armies are stacked. Selecting a city will
cause all armies in that city to attempt to combine, up to a
maximum level of 400,000 men. Army attributes for combined
armies are averaged, and the best commander of the armies
combined will assume leadership of the combined forces. (His
leadership ability may be reduced slightly to account for
the increased difficulty of commanding the larger forces.)

 4.5   Supply
=============
On occasion, you may need to manually allocate additional
provisions to units that are out of supply. These units may
be seen on the map marked with an "S" to make them easier to
locate. At the end of the move and update phase, units will
automatically receive 1 unit of supply, assuming enough
money is available. Automatic update of supply costs .002
money units per 1,000 men in the army unit. (For instance, a
22,000 man unit would require 44 money units to resupply).
This automatic resupply is done in numerical unit sequence,
so that higher numbered units are supplied last. If there is
not enough money to supply all units, or if the unit expends
more than expected supplies, or is blockaded in a port, some
will eventually get out of supply. Note that in the months
of July and September, units are resupplied without cost
(except for blockaded units).

To manually resupply, you must have enough money to provide
the supplies, which depends on the size of the army being
resupplied. Each unit of supply requires .001 money units
1,000 men (cheaper that automatic resupply). However, the
computer will attempt to allocate as much supply as possible
to the unit selected, up to a maximum of 5 units of supply.
If you do not have enough money to allocate at least 1 unit
of supply, none will be provided.
 
 4.6   Detach
=============
Either side may detach units from an existing army, provided
the original army is large enough (6,500 men or more) and

				- 16  -
 
there is an available Allies commander for the detached
unit. 30% of the original force is split into the new unit,
along with 30% of the supplies.

 4.7   Drill
============
Both sides may drill armies to increase their experience
level. Drilling requires one turn in which the army cannot
move. Experience gained in this manner cannot exceed the
leader's command rating, and is limited to a maximum of 5 in
any case.

 4.8   Relieve
==============
The Relieve option allows you to replace generals, thereby
removing them from their command. To be RELIEVED, a unit
cannot have already used its turn (e.g., cannot have move
orders). When a general is relieved, you are allowed to
replace him with another general from the list of available
commanders. When a general is relieved, the unit uses its
turn, and suffers two additional penalties. Both the
EXPERIENCE level and the LEADERSHIP level of the unit are
decreased by 1 because of confusion about the new leader's
style of command. The relieved general is placed on the list
of available commanders, awaiting possible future service.

game only.

 5.3   1-Player/2-Player
========================
Toggles between 1- and 2- player game.

 5.4   Noise
============
Toggle between Sound & Music, Sound Only, and Quiet.

 5.5   Tactical    (Registered Edition ONLY)
============================================
Toggle to set up tactical level battles when combat occurs
instead of the normal strategic level battle resolution. If
checked ("˚") tactical level battles will result if the
relative force strength is 3:1 or less. More lopsided
battles will still be resolved using the strategic level
combat. (Note: This option requires the Registered Edition).

 5.6   Display
==============
Sets display speed for messages displayed, from fast to very
slow. Slower speeds display messages longer, but also slow
movement and game play. This should be set as fast as possible
for your machine.

 5.7   Balance
==============
Set Play Balance from Allies++ (large Allies advantage) all
the way to French++ (large French advantage). Play balance
affects the relative resources allocated, along with the
handicap received in combat.

 5.8   End Game Conditions
==========================
Shows the conditions that will determine when the game is
over. These are specified in the input file NWS.INI, and can
be changed by changing that file. Up to 5 different preset
conditions may trigger the end of the game:

                Time (Month & Year)

				- 18  -
 
                % Cities Controlled by Either Side
                % Income for Either Side
                Objective Capture By Either Side *
                Ratio of Total Army Strength

In addition, the total elimination of either side's armies
will trigger a victory condition. Active conditions are
marked with an "˚". These may be toggled either off or on
(active) using this option by pressing ENTER when the
desired condition is highlighted, but the VALUES themselves
can only be changed in NWS.INI (see "Files" section below).
If ANY of the active conditions are achieved by EITHER SIDE,
the game will end. If there are NO active end game
conditions, the game will continue indefinitely.

* Note: If BOTH sides lose their objectives in the same turn,
  the game does NOT end even if this condition is active.

 5.9   Victory Condition Override
=================================
There is an override option when victory conditions signal
the end of the game. This allows you to keep playing if you
choose instead of abruptly ending the game. Each time the
override is used it increases the victory condition that was
triggered. Overriding victory conditions during game play will
result in a penalty to your score.

 5.10  Random Events
====================
Control over random events has been extended in the Utility
menu option. Random events can be toggled OFF so they do not
occur. If random events are ON, the degree to which they
favor one side or the other can be controlled:

    Favor French  (70% of random events help the French)
    Neutral (50% help the French; 50% help the Allies)
    Favor Allies (70% of random events help the Allies)

Historically, Napoleon had problems with subordinates who were
disloyal, sometimes to the point of treachery. This is reflected
in the random events where sometimes French commanders will turn
over their armies to the Allies.

 5.11  Vary Start
=================
Selecting this option at the beginning of the game will

				- 19  -
 
give different starting conditions.


 5.12  Enemy Aggression
=======================
This option applies only for 1-player game. By repeated
selecting this option you may cycle through enemy
aggressiveness levels from 0 (least aggressive) to 5 (most
aggressive). The default level is 1. At the lower levels,
the enemy will be more cautious and defensive, preferring to
build forts and make attacks only when the odds are
favorable. At the higher levels, the enemy will attack more
often, perhaps even to the point of foolhardiness.

 5.13  Save Configuration
=========================
Allows the options selected in the Utility menu to be saved as
your customized configuration.

===========================================================
 6   M O V E    &    C O M B A T    P H A S E
===========================================================
 6.1   Computer Decisions
=========================
If you are playing a 1-player game versus the computer, you
will see the computer decisions being made. The computer
does not 'cheat' by taking advantage of knowledge of the
moves you have selected.  If the side played by the computer
has an advantage in play balance, it will be a more
difficult opponent because it will get more resources, and
will receive a combat handicap.

You will be prompted to "press any key for month /year
events". During the update phase, the message "UPDATE" will
appear to the right of the map area. The computer will move
the armies, provide information on battles, state of
supplies, and so on. From time to time the display will
pause to give you time to read the messages. You can press
any key to move on.

 6.2   Army Movement
====================
When you see the message "press any key for (current month
and year) events", the move and update phase has begun.
During this phase both sides have their move orders carried
out. When enemy armies meet in the same city, combat occurs.

				- 20  -
 
After combat, only one side will continue to occupy the
city. The side that was driven off loses the battle.

The order in which armies move depends on (1) ability of the
leader (better ones tend to move first), (2) supply (out of
supply units move last) and (3) a random factor. Armies
carry out their orders one at a time. The flag icon will
move from the starting location to the destination city.

 6.3  The Occupying Army
========================
When an army captures a city, that army becomes the occupying
army. If there are multiple armies in a city, only one (the
largest army remaining in that city) is considered the occupying
army, which is the first army to engage in combat when the city
is attacked.

 6.4   Unit Cohesion
====================
Allied armies sometimes suffer from having mixed
nationalities (i.e., leader is of a different nationality
than the army itself). In such cases, the unit will suffer
from a lack of cohesion, and will perform more poorly in
combat. (You may be able to remedy this by swapping
commanders using the RELIEVE option).

 6.5   Combat
=============
If combat occurs, a set of statistics will appear on the
right of the screen giving important information on how the
battle will be resolved. The information for both attacker
and defender begins with a base calculation, which goes
through a series of adjustments to arrive at a final value
for this battle.

   Item       Meaning
----------  -----------------------------------------------

 Base       Base combat strength, obtained by multiplying unit
            strength by .0001 and rounding up. Thus, an
            army with 23,000 men has a base combat strength
            of 3. The base for defenders is increased to
            account for their reduced exposure to fire.

 Ldr/Exp    Base combat strength, adjusted for leadership
            and experience. Armies outmanned by more than

				- 21  -
 
            5:1 will usually not receive this adjustment.
            However, elite armies with experience levels of
            8 or more automatically receive a bonus, even if
            hopelessly outnumbered. The army commanded by
            Napoleon receives a large bonus.

 Outman     Adjustment if army is small or the opposing army
            is much larger than this army proportionately.
            This occurs for the attacker if outnumbered by
            more than 5:1 or for the defender if outnumbered
            by more than 10:1.

 Supply     Additional adjustment if unit is out of supply
            (will be in contrasting color). Out-of-supply
            units fight at half strength.

 Cohesion   Penalty if the army commander is not of the same
            nationality as the army itself (e.g., Austrian
            commander leading a Prussian army).

 Difclt     Additional adjustment based on difficulty level.

 Fort       (FOR DEFENDERS ONLY) - Additional adjustment if
            location is fortified and defender has not moved
            or fought previously in this turn. NOTE:
            Occasionally an exceptional commander will get
            the fort bonus even if he has fought previously
            in the turn. A +1 fortification increases combat
            power by 50%; a +2 fortification doubles combat
            power.

The exact combat adjustment for outmanned armies is shown
below:
+-------------------------+---------------+---------------+
| Attacker/Defender Ratio |  Attack Adjust| Defend Adjust |
+=========================+===============+===============+
|     1:10 or worse       | set to 1 (min)|set to 30 (max)|
+-------------------------+---------------+---------------+
|     1:10 to  1:5        | set to 1 (min)|     + 2       |
+-------------------------+---------------+---------------+
|     1:5  to  1:2        |      - 2      |     + 2       |
+-------------------------+---------------+---------------+
|     1:2  to  2:1        |        0      |       0       |
+-------------------------+---------------+---------------+
|     2:1  to  3:1        |        0      |     - 2       |
+-------------------------+---------------+---------------+

				- 22  -
 
|     3:1  to  5:1        |      + 2      |     - 2       |
+-------------------------+---------------+---------------+
|     5:1  to 10:1        |      + 2      | set to 1 (min)|
+-------------------------+---------------+---------------+
|     10:1 or better      |set to 30 (max)| set to 1 (min)|
+-------------------------+----------------+--------------+
Note that this is in addition to any other combat
adjustments, such as leadership, fortification, supply, etc.


All combat adjustments are made sequentially, and the final
result is the one actually used in the combat calculations.
The final result for both the Attacker and the Defender is
shown in a highlighted box. The final values can never be
less than 1 nor more than 30. A calculation of the odds of
an attacker victory are also given as A GUIDE ONLY. The
computer actually resolves the combat separately from this
calculation of attacker odds, but it should provide a good
indicator of who is likely to win the battle.

The actual results of the battle will be displayed after you
press a key. The winner is announced in the pop-up window.
Casualty information (numbers and percentages for each side)
are shown at the bottom of the screen. Notice that an army
can win the battle but suffer greater losses than the enemy.

The loser must retreat to an adjacent friendly city. The
human player is given the option as to which city to retreat
to if his DEFENDING army must retreat (if there is more than
one choice for retreat). If there are no retreat options,
the loser will surrender. Even if there is a retreat option,
a unit may be so outnumbered and reduced in size so much
that it can no longer function. Such shattered units will
also surrender. When units surrender, their commanders are
PERMANENTLY removed from the game.

If there is more than one defending army in a city, the
attacker must defeat each defender one at a time until all
defenders are driven out before occupying the city.

 6.6   Income Update
====================
After all combat and moves are resolved, the supplies are
distributed, and income and victory points are updated based
on present game situations. Note that the Allied side always
receives income from other parts of Europe outside the

				- 23  -
 
region shown (e.g., the remainder of England). Thus, the
Allies in effect have an income bonus. Supplies are
distributed based on cash remaining, to the armies in
numerical order.

 7.1   Scenario Initialization File (NWSxxxx.INI
================================================
These data files are simple "flat ASCII" files and may be
customized as you wish to modify starting game conditions.
(It is good practice to copy the original as a backup
before you create a new one.) The program probably will
not run if you make errors in these files.

Examples of the actual data lines are shown below in the
boxed areas; comment lines before each of the data lines
describe the information in that line.

End Game Conditions (Month/Year, % Cities, % Income,
Objective Capture Flag, Total Force Strength Ratio)
+-----------------+
|6,1799,80,80,1,3 |
+-----------------+
The above example will end in 6th month of 1799 or if 80% of
cities are controlled by one side or if 80% of income is
gained by one side. It will also end if one of the objective
cities is captured (the "1") or if the army strength ratio
gets to 3 or more.

casualties, and Allied casualties.

War conditions for each country. This can vary from 0 (total
peace) to 100 (ultimate hatred). If it is above 50%, the
country is at war. The values in order correspond to
France,Austria,England,Russia,Prussia,and Spain.

 7.4   City Matrix (EUROxxxx.MAP)
=================================
Unless you are very experienced, you should not change this
file. (Even if you are experienced, you should make a back
up copy.) These are companion files for the scenarios, which
indicate the control and value of cities for various start
years (specified by the 'xxxx' portion of the file name).

Please note: Cities MUST be in alphabetical order based on
the city abbreviations used; the program depends on this
order for army movement, fortification identification, and
other options. STRANGE things may happen if your cities are
not alphabetized. There must be exactly 67 cities.

Format:
        City #,
        x VGA coordinate (1-530);
                upper left corner of screen is (0,0)

 8.1   Combat Model Adjustment
==============================
The combat model has been made more "open" to allow more
user customization. Three key combat factors are specified
immediately after the list of months in the GAMEDATA.INI
file.

  ATKFAC - the base attacker casualty rate. Default is 11%.
           This value is adjusted, depending on whether the
           defender is in a fortified position and whether
           the attacker wins.
  DEFAC  - the base defender casualty rate. Default is 9%.
           This value is adjusted, depending on whether the
           defender is in a fortified position and whether
           the defender wins.
  TCR    - the total combat range. Default is 30. This is
           the limit of adjusted combat factors for both
           the attacker and defender. Lower factors than
           30 will tend to make battle outcomes more
           influenced by random factors (luck). Higher
           factors than 30 will increasingly give the edge
           to the stronger army, particularly the one with
           the most troops. A value around 30 will cause

				- 28  -
 
           the stronger side to generally win, but still
           leave enough element of luck that the weaker
           army can occasionally defeat a stronger foe.
