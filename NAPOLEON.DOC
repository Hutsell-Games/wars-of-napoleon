         TACTICAL BATTLE MODULE - WARS OF NAPOLEON
===========================================================
 1 INTRODUCTION
===========================================================
 1.1    Description
===================
The tactical battle module for Wars of Napoleon is meant for
use within the Wars of Napoleon strategic game. Though it
can be used as a stand alone module to play random scenarios, it
is intended to resolve tactically battles in which the relative
strength ratios of the armies is in the range of 1:3 to 3:1. More
lopsided battles are resolved at the strategic level game).

The winner of the battle will take possession of the
contested city on the strategic level map. The loser must
retreat.

The battle is randomly set up based on the relative
strengths of the armies at the strategic level and their
morale, experience, and leadership.

If the strategic battle site is not fortified, the objective will
be near the defending army, but not necessarily possessed by it.
If it is fortified or double fortified, the objective will be
possessed by the defending army, and the terrain will be more
difficult.

IF EITHER ARMY IS OUT OF SUPPLY, ITS TACTICAL STRENGTH WILL
BE ONLY 50% OF THE NOMINAL STRENGTH. Thus, a 100,000 man
army out of supply will have only 50,000 strength points in
the tactical combat. (This could be a reason for a strategic
retreat).

 1.2  How to Win
================
To "win" the battle, you must either:
    (a) be holding the objective on the LAST turn of the
        battle, or
    (b) cause the esprit de corps of the enemy army
        to fall so low that the entire enemy army routs and
        leaves the field of battle

 1.3  Quitting the Game (Strategic Retreat)
===========================================
By pressing F9 and confirming, you can cause your army to

				- 2  -
 
strategically retreat - thereby losing the objective and
taking a 20% additional loss. You might wish to do this
to avoid even greater losses on the battlefield.

 1.4  The Objective
===================
The objective is a battlefield location. It is "controlled"
by the army that last had a unit on that location. It is not
necessary to keep a unit on the objective to maintain
control of it (though a unit left on the objective can
defend it against an enemy assault).

 1.5  Esprit de Corps
=====================
Each army has a "spirit" that reflects its overall morale -
the esprit de corps, which you can monitor using the 'G'
game score hot key. When critical events occur, the esprit
de corps can rise or fall. If it gets too low, the entire
army will break and run and the battle is over.

The esprit de corps for an army rises when it takes the
objective, eliminates an enemy unit, or pursues a retreating
unit.

The esprit de corps for an army falls when one of its units
is routed or eliminated. Having General units eliminated is
particularly damaging to spirit.

 1.6  Battle Screen
===================
The battle screen is divided into 4 zones as shown:

+==========================================================+

 1.7  Battle Map & Terrain
==========================
The battle map is based on a hexagonal layout, 27 hexes wide
by 20 hexes high, with terrain features shown by EGA graphic
icons. More complete information is provided on-line via the
F1 help key.

The map is randomly generated for each battle.

  DESCRIPTION             MOVEMENT EFFECT
----------------------- ---------------------
  forest/wooded terrain    slow
  road                     fast
  bridge                   fast
  clear or open terrain    normal
  swamp/small stream       very slow
  hill/elevation           slow
  river/lake/water         extremely slow
  mountain                 very slow
  fortification            normal
  objective                normal
  village/house            normal

 1.8  'Terrain' Command
=======================
You can view the terrain without the army units at any time by
pressing "T" (for Terrain). This temporarily toggles the unit
icons off, then replaces all visible units after you have viewed
the terrain.

 1.9  Armies Summary Data
=========================
The number of turns remaining in the battle is shown in the
top section of this zone. A summary is given of the total
losses incurred by each army and the number of turns each
side has controlled the objective. The side you are playing
is indicated by a '' character. The side currently
controlling the objective is indicated by a '' character.

 1.10  Active Unit Data
=======================
A summary is given for the current player-controlled unit,
showing unit number, unit name, unit type, current strength,
terrain, leadership, and morale. In addition, the time the
unit will next be available for movement is shown. If the

				- 4  -
 
unit is under 'orders', the message "ORDERS" will appear
next to the unit number.

 1.11 Message Window
====================
The message window provides comments on battle maneuvers and
outcomes as they occur. It also shows when the enemy
(computer) is taking its turn.

===========================================================
 2 UNIT TYPES & ATTRIBUTES
===========================================================
 2.1  Unit Types
================
There are 4 basic unit types, Infantry, Artillery, Cavalry,
and Generals. In addition, Infantry units may form hollow
Squares for defensive purposes. They are shown on the display by
distinctive "standard" military icons, in red for Allied units
and blue for French units. (Press 'F1' to get a full display of
icons, terrain features and effects, and hot key commands).

                       Melee
Type       Movement    Combat     Special Abilities
-------    -------    --------    -------------------------
Infantry   average     average    may 'charge' on open
                                  ground if morale is
                                  sufficiently high.
                                  Vulnerable to enemy
                                  cavalry attacks and likely
                                  to rout if overrun by
                                  cavalry.

Hollow     none        defensive  good vs. cavalry attacks;
Squares                           poor vs. infantry attacks

Cavalry    fast        good       excellent attack on open
                                  terrain, especially
                                  vs. infantry

Artillery  slow        poor       may fire on units at a
                                  distance

General    average     poor       increased combat effect on
                                  adjacent friendly units;
                                  can cancel orders of other
                                  units; can inspire units

				- 5  -
 
                                  into action; can inspire
                                  routed units to regroup

 2.2  Routed Units
==================
Units that suffer large melee losses may ROUT. The unit icon
will change to that of a shattered unit and the unit will
immediately begin to flee from the combat area toward the
edge of the map. Once routed, units are very vulnerable to
further attack, and will take huge losses. If a routed unit
is able to withdraw without being attacked, it will attempt
to regroup on each turn it gets. If it moves to the edge of
the map, it will stop and continue to try to regroup.

Nearby General units may be able to iNspire routed units
before they move to the edge of the map.

Even when routed units are able to regroup, their fighting
ability will be greatly reduced.

Each time a unit routs, the overall esprit de corps for the
unit's entire army is reduced.

 2.3  Hollow Squares
====================
Infantry that is attacked by cavalry on open terrain is
likely to take large losses and even rout. However, if the
infantry can form into hollow squares, it is much more able
to fend off the cavalry attacks. While in hollow squares,
the infantry unit cannot move.

 2.4  Cavalry vs. Cavalry
=========================
When cavalry units that meet on open terrain, there is a
tremendous test of nerves as the horses, men, sabers, and
pikes all converge. The losing unit is very likely to rout.
Even the victorious unit may rout.

 2.5   Morale and Leadership
============================
Units which have poor leadership lower will have difficulty
in movement and combat. Likewise, units with low morale will
not be very effective, and should be rested if possible.
Units with low morale cannot 'charge' and may not have
enough discipline to form hollow squares.


				- 6  -
 
 2.6    Generals
================
A General unit greatly improves the fighting abilities of
adjacent units, both attack and defense. In addition,
Generals have a powerful ability to iNspire units into
action or to X cancel orders. However, you must be careful
in actually engaging General unit itself, since it is
usually weak and not very effective in melee.

 2.7  [X]cancel Orders
======================
Sometimes in the thick of battle you will have units engaged
in combat (and not moving) or with movement orders which you
need to redirect. To cancel existing orders for all friendly
units, type 'X' when a General unit has its turn. As
described earlier, this is not 100% effective (some units
will ignore it) and may cause morale and leadership to
suffer in units that do comply.

Friendly units that are "under orders" are indicated on the
map as units WITHOUT a contrasting color border. For
instance, French units normally have a light blue border,
but French units currently under orders do not have the
border.

When a General cancels orders, units that obey will flash
briefly after the order is issued. Then a message indicates
how many units obeyed out of the total currently 'under
orders'. This allows you to see whether you need to issue
additional commands to cancel orders.

 2.8  i[N]spire Units
=====================
General units may issue an iNspire command to rally another
unit or to cause a routed unit to regroup and halt its
flight from the battle.. The hot key for this command is 'N'
(for iNspire). Using this command, a General unit may
activate another unit nearby if the target unit is close
enough and if the General has sufficient leadership.

The "iNspired" unit normally will activate and be ready to
move within the next turn

===========================================================
 3 VISIBILITY & MOVEMENT
===========================================================

				- 7  -
 
 3.1   Visibility
=================
All your friendly units are visible, but enemy units are not
always visible. Enemy units do not become visible until they
come near enough to one of your units. If your unit occupies
a mountain or hill it has increased ability to see enemy
units; while occupying a forest or swamp, it has decreased
ability to see enemy units. If the enemy is in a forest, he
is much more difficult to see, and your unit must be closer.
Enemies that move into forests may disappear from view.

 3.2    Movement
================
When one of your units is ready to move, it will be
highlighted and a short tone will sound. At that point, you
have several command options as described below.

 3.3   Controlling Diagonal Moves
=================================
Diagonal movement is supported in this module, using the
numeric key pad, with NUMLOCK turned OFF, as shown below:

                    +------+------+------+
                    |  7   |  8   |  9   |
 Move UP & LEFT ----->     |      |     <----- Move UP & RIGHT
                    | Home |      | PgUp |
                    +------+------+------+
                    |  4   |  5   |  6   |
    Move LEFT ------->     |      |     <----- Move RIGHT
                    |      |      |      |
                    +------+------+------+
                    |  1   |  2   |  3   |
 Move DOWN & LEFT --->     |      |     <----- Move DOWN & RIGHT
                    | End  |      | PgDn |
                    +------+------+------+

Note that this scheme is required because the map is hex-based.
The game will respond to the Up or Down moves (either on the
numeric keypad, or the "inverted T" arrows), but since there are
no directly up or down moves on the map, it must convert them to
a diagonal move, which is done on a 50%-50% random basis, either
left or right.

 3.4   Single Hex Movement
==========================
You may move the unit to an adjacent unoccupied hex by using

				- 8  -
 
the appropriate arrow key (numeric key pad). Since the unit
may not move directly up or down on the hexagonal map, the
'up' or 'down' keys are reinterpreted as diagonal 'up' or
'down' moves. You cannot control whether these reinterpreted
diagonal moves are right or left (done randomly), so you
should generally avoid using the 'up' and 'down' keys for
single hex movement.

If you attempt to move into a prohibited hex (occupied or
water), a tone will sound. There is no movement penalty.

After the unit moves, it may reveal enemy units that were
previously hidden.

Any units that were entrenched at the beginning of the
scenario (using the scenario editor) may be reluctant to
move from the safety of their trenches. Occasionally such
units will not respond to move orders (a message to that
effect is displayed). Units that are low on morale or that
are poorly led are more likely to do this.

 3.5   Move-to-Location Orders
==============================
Single hex movement may be tedious. You may wish to give
your units orders to move to a particular location instead.
To do this, press 'M' when the unit is highlighted and a
cursor will appear on top of the unit. Move this cursor with
the arrow keys to the desired destination, and press
'Enter'. When the "move to" order is issued, the destination
is will be indicated by a small white circle and a line will
connect the unit with its intended target. On its next turn,
your unit will then begin to move to the selected
destination, following the most direct path. (It will not
necessarily follow the same path you used in moving the
cursor to the destination). If it is blocked by a friendly
unit or by prohibited terrain (water or edge of map screen),
or if the unit is attacked in any way, the movement order
will be cancelled, and the unit will wait for new
instructions.

Artillery units must be LIMBERED to move. Orders can be
issued to unlimbered artillery, but the orders are ignored,
and the unit will not move. Emplaced artillery can not
receive move-to-location orders.

For destinations that are far away, moving the cursor may be

				- 9  -
 
speeded by holding down 'Shift' before pressing the desired
arrow key. The cursor will then move to the indicated map
edge. Pressing the '5' key at the center of the key pad will
center the cursor on the screen.

Once a unit has reached its assigned destination, it will
flash and a tone will sound, along with a message that it
has arrived at its destination. At that point its orders are
cancelled, and it will await further instructions.

While units are 'under orders' to move you will not normally
be able to access them, even if you change your mind about
what they should do. The only way you can overcome this is
having one of your General units cancel the unit orders
using the 'X' command. (See 'hot keys' section). This is not
100% effective (due to communication breakdowns and stubborn
subordinate officers). Even if the orders are actually
cancelled, morale and leadership may be reduced in units
affected due to the conflicts between unit commanders and
General unit. Thus, the 'cancel orders' option should be
used only as needed to free units that have become locked in
combat.

Since the General units are your only means to cancel
orders, you should usually not give them movement orders.
That way, you will be able to access them more frequently.

Though your units will normally wait for your commands, on
occasion they will decide to move on their own initiative
(generally in an attempt to engage an enemy unit which they
have sighted). Such units issue their own orders to move to
the chosen destination.

 3.6  Infantry Charge
=====================
Infantry units ONLY may double their speed for short
distances on OPEN TERRAIN OR ROADS only with a 'C' (CHARGE)
command. Units in 'charge' mode will be shown with a
distinctive icon. While in 'charge' mode they will move
twice as fast as normal infantry.

If charging units become involved in combat, or are attacked
by artillery, or move into any other than open or roads
terrain, they will switch out of 'charge' mode. In addition,
each time a unit in 'charge' mode is moved, there is a
chance that the unit will simply become too tired to

				- 10  -
 
continue the charge. Units that are moved until they are too
tired will be delayed in their action for a time while they
rest.

The 'charge' option affects both movement and combat
(increases 'shock' effect of attacks). Units with too low
morale will not be able to charge at all until their morale
improves.

Note that switching to 'charge' mode requires one turn. Then
the unit may be moved a single hex or given orders.

 3.7   Rest
===========
You may not wish to move a unit on its turn. By pressing the
space bar you can skip the unit and allow it to rest for a
few turns. If the unit's morale is low, it will improve
slightly after resting.

 3.8   Wait
===========
To avoid having to repeatedly issue a 'Rest' order, an
option is provided whereby units may 'Wait'. Press 'W' when
the unit has its turn. The unit icon will change to a solid
colored block. The unit will become inactive, automatically
resting to regain morale. The unit will reactivate if
attacked (either melee or cannonade). Waiting units suffer
no penalty if attacked.

In addition, you may activate the WAITing unit at any time
another friendly unit has a turn. Press 'I' for the
intelligence cursor and pass it over the inactive unit you
wish to wake. The icon will change to the normal icon. Now
press 'esc' and the first unit can take whatever action you
wish.

 3.9   Stacking
===============
Normally, units cannot move onto other friendly units
(stack). However, units can now be stacked under certain
conditions:

   (a) TOTAL unit strength resulting from stacking must be
       stack limit or less (stack limit default is 500)
   (b) If dissimilar units are stacked, an INFANTRY unit
       will result, unless one of the units is a

				- 11  -
 
       GENERAL, in which case a GENERAL will result

The leadership value for the stacked unit will usually be
the higher of the two units that are being combined. An
exception is if one of the units is a General and the other
is not; in that case, the resulting leadership value is
always that of the General unit.

Morale will generally INCREASE slightly if LIKE units are
stacked. It will generally DECREASE slightly if UNLIKE units
are stacked.

Stacking results in a time delay for the unit to get
reorganized. The reorganization delay is reduced if
leadership is high.

===========================================================
 4 COMBAT
===========================================================
 4.1  Normal (Melee) Combat
===========================
Units can attack enemy units in an adjacent hex. To do so,
attempt to move the selected unit on top of the enemy. A
menu will appear in the 'Armies Summary Data' zone of the
screen showing the attack options. Four different
intensities of attack are permitted:

         Option         Relative Intensity
     --------------     ------------------
     Light Skirmish             1
     Medium Fight               2
     Heavy Attack               3
     All-Out Assault            8

Note the 'All-Out Assault' is just that, and that it should
be used relatively sparingly, since it will result in heavy
casualties for BOTH sides. If you do not wish to attack at
all, you may cancel the attack by pressing the 'escape' key;
however, that will forfeit the unit's turn for the current
round (the price paid for indecision).

Normally your units will wait for you to issue an attack
order. However, they may occasionally attack on their own
initiative. When this happens, you will receive a message in
the 'Message Window' zone, and the attack intensity menu
will appear for you to select the intensity, as described

				- 12  -
 
above. Pressing 'Esc' will abort the attack for now, but the
unit will miss its turn.

When units become engaged in combat, they are somewhat
'locked in place', and their ability to respond to orders is
reduced. They also are more likely to act on their own
initiative, to renew the combat without any orders to do so.

 4.2   Artillery
================
Artillery units may bombard visible enemy units some
distance away, rather than melee adjacent units (which they
do very poorly anyway). To fire the cannons, press 'F' (for
'FIRE') when the artillery unit is given its turn to move.
(If LIMBER option is ON, you will be prompted to unlimber
first)

When you fire artillery, a cursor will appear. Also, the
range of the cannon and the current distance to target is
displayed in the 'Message Window'. If the cursor is moved
out of range of the cannon, the distance will be highlighted
(to remind you it is out of range). You may move the cursor
using the key pad (as described earlier for unit movement)
to the selected target, then press 'Enter'. Both the firing
cannon battery and the defending unit are highlighted until
the results are displayed in the 'Message Window' and in the
'Armies Summary'.

When firing artillery, the valid enemy targets only will be
visible during the firing phase. Valid targets must be in range.
Additionally,if the line of sight option is ON, they must also be
in line of sight. ALL visible enemy units will reappear after
firing.

Range of the artillery depends on the same factors as visibility
(elevation and cover).

Enemy artillery will concentrate more fire on units that
threaten the artillery unit (especially those immediately
adjacent). Damage from canister fire at close range is often
devastating. This makes artillery units tough to overrun if
they have a chance to fire.

There is a (low) probability of artillery exploding and
killing members of the firing battery.


				- 13  -
 
 4.3  Line of Sight
===================
Line of sight restricts artillery units to fire only at
enemy units not blocked by obstructing terrain features.
Line of sight is considered by tracing an approximate
straight line path from the firing unit to the enemy (while
keeping to the map hexes). Line of sight is traced until an
obstruction is encountered. If there are no obstructions,
the line of sight is reported as clear. Otherwise, the
artillery unit cannot see the enemy and is prohibited from
firing at that target.

Trees, villages, hills and mountains are considered
obstructions. Army units are NOT considered as obstructions.

A firing unit on a hill may see over ONE obstructed hex with
a forest or village (but not any additional obstructed
hexes). A firing unit on a hill cannot see over a hill or
mountain.

A firing unit on a mountain may see over TWO obstructed
forest or village hexes. A firing unit on a mountain can see
over ONE hill, but never over another mountain.

 4.4  'View' Command to Check Line of Sight
===========================================
Any unit may check for visible enemy units within line of
sight from the location of the checking unit by typing 'V'
(for 'VIEW'). This helps you scout where to set up your
artillery. Visible terrain hexes are shown in reverse color,
as are visible friendly units. Enemy units visible to the
checking unit are shown in normal colors. Enemy units that
are not visible to the checking unit are not displayed until
you press a key.

 4.5  Limbering Artillery
=========================
A 'limber' feature is provided to add realism by requiring
all land-based artillery units (Artillery-Rifled, Napoleon,
and Horse Artillery) to limber before being moved and to
unlimber before being fired. The 'L' hot key will toggle
land-based artillery units between limbered and unlimbered
states. A LIMBERED unit is represented on the map by an open
circle (think of it as a "wheel") and its unit description
has an 'L' in front of the name (e.g. LArtillery).
Changing between limbered/unlimbered requires additional

				- 14  -
 
time. In addition, units with low morale will be even
slower to limber or unlimber.

Limbered artillery is extremely vulnerable to attack, either
melee or artillery fire. Limbered artillery is very
ineffective in melee attack.

Unlimbered artillery unit types cannot retreat until they
are limbered. This means unlimbered artillery units simply
have to take the punishment while they are under attack.

 4.6  Cannonade
===============
Attacks by cannons are a special type of combat. The outcome
depends on the strength of the attacking unit, the strength
of the defending unit, the terrain, and luck. Given the more
uncertain nature of this form of combat, the outcomes are
more variable. However, in the long run cannonades will
cause considerable damage. Cannonades against units
immediately next to the artillery unit will cause twice the
normal damage, as the defenders receive fire at pointblank
range.

 4.7  Cavalry Charge
====================
When cavalry in a CLEAR or ROAD hex attacks an enemy also in
a CLEAR of ROAD hex, the cavalry may 'charge' (receive an
attack bonus). The charge option is automatically put into
effect and a special message will announce it. Note that
bridge hexes do not allow charges due to the constricted
space.

 4.8  Resolving Combat
======================
In resolving the combat, the attacker goes first, then the
defender. While the attacker is attacking, the defender's
terrain is used in determining defender casualties. When the
defender returns fire, the attacker's terrain is used in
determining extent of attacker casualties.

Attacking is risky business, since the attacker must expose
himself, while the defender can take advantage of whatever
cover is available. Thus, attackers will generally take
proportionally more casualties. The results will be
displayed as the battle progresses in the 'Armies Summary'
area and in the 'Message Window'. Morale of both armies

				- 15  -
 
under fire will decrease.

 4.9  Combat Results
====================
The primary factors affecting combat results are shown
below:

 Factor               Relative Effect
 -----                ---------------------
 Intensity .......... Major
 Unit Strength ...... Major
 Unit Leadership .... Moderate (major if very high or low)
 Unit Morale ........ Moderate (major if very low)
 Unit Experience......Moderate (major if very high or low)
 Terrain ............ Moderate (major for some
 (see note)                     conditions, such as cavalry
                                in swamps)
 Unit Type .......... Moderate (major if Artillery or
                                General units directly
                                involved in combat)
 Adjacent Friendly .. Moderate
 General
 LUCK ............... Slight-Moderate
 Adjacent Friendly
 Unit ............... Slight

 NOTE: The terrain occupied by BOTH combatants is considered
 in adjusting combat outcome. A unit is at a disadvantage in
 swamps, but is at an advantage in forest or hill hexes. A
 unit is at a considerable advantage on mountains or in fort
 hexes. Cavalry and Artillery units (all types) are
 particularly disadvantaged in swamps, and somewhat
 disadvantaged in forests. Entrenchment (if any) is also
 considered. Entrenched units gain a bonus in addition to
 any terrain effect.

 4.10 Retreat
=============
If a unit takes particularly heavy casualties, and
leadership and morale are sufficiently low, it will decide
to retreat. When this happens, the unit attempts to move to
one of the 3 hexes furthest from the attacker. The selected
hex must be an unoccupied hex. When a unit attempts to pull
back, a message will appear and the unit will appear in
purple. When an army retreats, its morale suffers, and it
takes a few additional casualties as wounded men are

				- 16  -
 
captured.

Since pulling back means exposure to enemy fire, units will
take additional casualties when they decide to retreat.
Units that are cut off and unable to retreat will take heavy
additional losses in the confusion, and are very likely to
rout. Botched retreats will also reduce effectiveness of
unit leadership.

Sometimes the enemy unit will have to retreat as well, if it
has taken heavy losses. In some instances, one unit in
combat will have to retreat while the victor has not taken
much damage. The victorious unit may advance to pursue the
fleeing unit. Morale increases for the pursuing unit;
leadership may also improve, as the commander hones his
skills.

The human attacker is given the option to pursue if
the computer must retreat.

 4.11 Eliminated Units
======================
Occasionally units will be eliminated from the battle. This
is announced in the message window and an "death's head"
icon will appear in the hex the eliminated unit occupied.
When this happens, esprit de corps values will shift.

If one side is completely annihilated by having ALL of its
units eliminated, the battle will end.

 4.12 Capturing Artillery
=========================
In the case of eliminated artillery, some portion of the
eliminated unit may be captured by the attacker. This will
occur if the artillery unit is large enough and there is an
unused unit for the new artillery unit that will be formed.
To capture the artillery, the attacker must pursue into the
hex where the eliminated unit had been. The option to
capture occurs only when the artillery unit is eliminated.
If not captured, the eliminated unit is permanently removed
from the remainder of the battle.

===========================================================
 5 HOT KEY COMMANDS
===========================================================
 5.1  Hot Keys

				- 17  -
 
==============
In addition to the movement and combat commands, there are
several commands available during the battle. Some of these
are accessed through the menus described later. Most can be
reached using 'hot keys' as described below.

    Command                    Use
-----------+----------------------------------------
(space bar)| Rest the unit - skip a turn
    G      | Game score
    O      | Order of battle summary
    Q      | Toggle between SOUND and QUIET
-----------+----------------------------------------
    I      | Intelligence on visible units
           | and Activate WAITed units
    M      | Move to destination - give move orders
    T      | Terrain - temporarily remove all unit icons
    V      | View line of sight (All Units)
    W      | Wait (All Units)
-----------+----------------------------------------

  (F3)     | Screen Redraw
-----------Å----------------------------------------                                         -

 5.2  Intelligence
==================
This option causes cursor to appear on your highlighted
unit. The cursor may be moved to get strength and terrain
information on any unit that is currently visible. Press
'esc' when done. Placing the cursor over a friendly unit
will display that unit's current status in the 'active unit
data' window.

If the friendly unit under the cursor is WAITed, it will
activate on its next time of action. (Note that this may not
be immediately).

Intelligence is useful to identify units that are weak or

				- 18  -
 
are bogged down by terrain or combat and not likely to move
very soon. When doing an intelligence scan of friendly units
that are 'under orders' to go to a specific location, that
location is shown on the map and with a line connected to
the unit.

Use of the Intelligence command does not cost a turn. This
gives the human player more information in selecting units
to attack.

 5.3  Rest
==========
This option is described in elsewhere. The Wait option
allows units to repeatedly rest.

 5.4  (special options)
=======================
This option will appear only if a General, Artillery, or
Infantry type unit is waiting for orders. It will give these
options:

           Cancel Orders   (General)
           Fire            (Artillery)
           Charge          (Infantry)
           Square          (Infantry)

Note that all of these may be directly accessed using the
appropriate 'hot key'

 5.5  Order of Battle ('O')
===========================
This option gives a detailed listing of all your units and
their status, as well as listings of known (visible) enemy
units. While the information for your own units is accurate,
it is only approximately correct for enemy units. Units in
trouble will be shown in red.

 5.6  Game Score ('G')
======================
This option gives the current game score, showing who is
currently winning, as well as the esprit de corps scores for
both sides. Scoring depends on relative casualties, number of
units eliminated, and number of turns of control of the
objective.

 5.7  F3-Screen Redraw
This option redraws the screen.
